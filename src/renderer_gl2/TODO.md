# RENDERER
An attempt to bring renderer to OpenGL 2.1, while making it many times faster than GL1.4 renderer


## TODO:
- anistropic texture filtering
- entities should be lit by lightgrid instead of lightmap pixel underneath them (which is awful for objects in air) -- add support for `LIGHTGRID_OCTREE`
- setup projection without immediate calls
- get rid of IM translation/rotation -- calculate matrices and pass them to shaders
- convert remaining code that does immediate rendering (glBegin/glEnd) to vertex buffers
- local entities rendering and culling based on PVS ?
- alphatest is gone in newer opengl, do it in shaders, remove calls to `glAlphaTest`
- exponential fog + make it cull objects that are completly occluded
- MD5 models and skeletal animations (maybe?)
- add `r_picmip` back
- particles can be optionaly lit
- sky rendering code is awful
- add beams back

## PARTIALY DONE:
- dynamic lights -- spotlights incorectly lit bmodels and entities, need to unify world and entity dlighting
- use GLSL shaders for diferent gemoetries - sky [partial], models [done], warps [-], world [partial], gui [done], particles [done], etc..
- move viewblend to shader (problem: it looks worse)
- multitexture support -- currently only two TMUs, we need more forl ighting changes

## DONE:
- render brushmodels and entirity of world with vertexbuffers
- add per pixel lighting
- move lightstyles to GPU
- upload all lightmaps to GPU and not waste cpu clocks for updates (aitest.bsp ~120fps with old code vs ~370fps now on my machine)
- render `GL_POLYGON` as `GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP`
- all UI rendering is now done with vertexbuffers (bringing up console no longer tanks FPS)
- support `QBISM` extended BSP format allowing for greatly more advanced maps
- world loading code is aware of `BSPX` lumps
- decoupled lightmap coords from texture coords (`DECOUPLED_LM` lump) - this also allows for much higher (or lower) quality lightmaps
- configurable `LMSHIFT` (was needed for `DECOUPLED_LM`)
- support GLSL shaders
- implement framebuffer objects and render all the world to texture for post processing
- get rid of `GL_QUAD` primitives
- make `r_gamma` not require restarts
- cull MD3 models based on distance and frustum
- post processing effects such as film grain, saturation, contrast, intensity, grayscale, blur, etc..
- render MD3 models with vbos
- animate MD3 models entirely on GPU -- this has improved pefrormance from 3-6fps to >200fps on my machine (bench1.bsp, 362 animated models, ~5mil vert transforms)
- use opengl to generate mipmaps, thus allow for better textures
- remove calls to `glColor`, use uniforms instead
- particles can be of any size
